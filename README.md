# Steam Play - Sonic CD 2011 Decompilation 

Sonic CD but you can run it on steam on linux. A fork of this project https://git.froggi.es/eukara/reGTA-SteamPlay

# Dependencies
None, it expects your /bin/sh to handle arrays and things though.

# Installation
If you use a Steam Deck, just go into desktop mode.

In order to install it, you just clone
the repository into your $HOME/.steam/steam/compatibilitytools.d/SonicCD-steamplay directory.
If those those folders don't exist, just create the folders and dump the repository there.

After doing that, go to Sonic CD's properties on steam and force a Steam Play compatitbility tool and then pick SonicCD-Decomp
